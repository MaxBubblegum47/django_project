I've a little Blog with user registration, in order the learn better how to use Django framework! I'm also very noob with css/html, so it helps me a lot in order to understand better fullstack webdev world. I didn't upload sqlite3.dbms file so you need to run python manage.py makemigration and then python manage.py migrate in your django_project folder to run it properly. Pay attention: is more convenient for you if you call the main project foler as "django_project", otherwise you need to edit some files in the project.
